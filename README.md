# AddressBook
This first version of the Address Book provides minimal functionality, and is not very well written.  It is not written with expansion or support in mind, does not allow for input validation or exception checking.
In short, in a minimum, bad app that only barely does its job; badly in need of improvement.

Written using windows forms, .net core 5.0 and c# 9.0
